# Crypto Systems Main Project
## Getting data from Google sheets documents (fetched before)
- Crypto prices
- Coins List
## Writing to Google sheets documents 
- Writing directly to a sheet (create new if don't exists) when range specified
- Append to the sprecified sheet if no range is specified

## Last done
Created get_beta() with fetching prices from googlesheets
Created calculate_beta_scores.py file
Created import_calculated_beta_to_google_sheet()
- Check where the beta scores are passed
- Try to add TOTAL with the py library
- Try to reduce the requests sent to google sheets for prices in get beta where btc is called every time
- Make calculate_beta_scores.py more automatic and check variables, function arguments, returns etc.
- Add logic to handle 429 error to many request by waiting and retrying
The logic in calculate_beta_scores.py file should be added in a main script that will update the whole systems 

After making this changes i need to push to git to refresh the codes there
Check ToDo sheet in RSPS LV3 spreadsheet for todos extra.

# Rebuild and push:
    - docker build -t europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/crypto-systems-main/systems-docker-repo/crypto-systems-main:latest .
    - docker push europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/crypto-systems-main/systems-docker-repo/crypto-systems-main:latest

# Recommended Command with Adjustments
#### To maximize success and address potential issues, hereâ€™s an enhanced version of your command:
    gcloud run deploy crypto-systems-main \
    --image europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/crypto-systems-main/systems-docker-repo/crypto-systems-main:latest \
    --platform managed \
    --region europe-west1 \
    --port 8080 \
    --timeout 600 \
    --memory 1Gi \
    --cpu 1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --service-account your-service-account@crypto-systems-main.iam.gserviceaccount.com
### Changes Made (Explained):
    --port 8080: Explicitly sets the port to match your Flask app.
    --timeout 600: Allows 10 minutes for main_beta(), covering the 183.9-second requests.
    --memory 1Gi: Provides ample memory for data processing.
    --cpu 1: Keeps the default CPU but can be increased to 2 if needed.
    --service-account: Placeholder for your Google Sheets service account (replace with the correct email or omit if using the default and it has permissions).

## Command to deploy Docker Container from Artifact Registry:
